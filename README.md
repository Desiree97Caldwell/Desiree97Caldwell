## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a cloud engineer focused on automating infrastructure using Terraform and AWS. This space is dedicated to sharing my work in Infrastructure as Code (IaC), cloud architecture, and automation practices that help streamline deployment, improve scalability, and ensure consistency across environments.

My primary focus is on building repeatable, version-controlled infrastructure using Terraform. I write modular, reusable Terraform configurations that follow best practices in code organization, input validation, and output structuring. Whether itâ€™s provisioning VPCs, managing IAM roles, deploying EC2 instances, or setting up managed services like RDS or S3, I aim to build secure, scalable, and well-documented infrastructure.

Working with AWS, I design cloud-native architectures that leverage services like Lambda, ECS, CloudWatch, and Route 53. I emphasize automation, cost-efficiency, and resilience in every solution, applying the principles of the AWS Well-Architected Framework to ensure high availability and operational excellence.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find a collection of Terraform modules, complete environment setups, and real-world use cases for automating AWS infrastructure. Each project includes clear documentation, variable files, and example usage to make it easy to integrate or adapt to different cloud setups. I also incorporate tools like Terragrunt for managing configurations across multiple environments and backends.

My goal is to reduce manual processes, eliminate configuration drift, and empower teams to deploy infrastructure safely and predictably. Iâ€™m continuously learning and refining my practices, keeping up with the latest updates in both Terraform and AWS.

Feel free to explore the code, open issues, or contribute ideas. Iâ€™m always interested in collaborating with other cloud engineers, DevOps practitioners, and developers working on infrastructure automation and cloud-native solutions.
